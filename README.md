# Classifying Garbage Types on the Raspberry Pi 5
You can read the [associated research paper here.](https://github.com/AngelaVilladiego/pi-waste-classifier/blob/main/Smart%20Waste%20Classification%20System%20using%20Machine%20Learning.pdf)

If you'd like to see how the model was trained, take a look at [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bp0brf4YMm3AuXwYFHnyCpd1I9-3rEVi?usp=sharing) which contains only very minor changes from [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aadhavvignesh/pytorch-garbage-classification-95-accuracy/notebook#Training-the-Model:).

The dataset used for training was the [trashnet dataset](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) with compost images from [compostnet](https://github.com/sarahmfrost/compostnet), more compost images taken with a mobile phone, and pictures taken directly in the environment/setup of the Raspberry Pi added.
